# Special-Dice-Simulator
Fundamental Data Structures Course Project - Creates emulation for the symbol polyhedral dice  used in Star Wars TTRPGs

### Specification
I am aiming to create a program that acts as a non-visual(no GUI) dice roller for non-numeric polyhedral dice.
The program will use the probability and symbols of the dice used for “The Edge of the Empire” and “Age of Rebellion” Star Wars tabletop role-playing games, which are identical. 
Pictures for reference and dice definitions at the end of the file. The program will load a set number of each die type, the user will then select how many of which to roll.
The program can then output the roll results and do the necessary cancellations to present the final result. 

### Usage
The FDSProject_BGK.cpp file contains the main function of the project.
